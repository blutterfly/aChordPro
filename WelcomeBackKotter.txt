{Verse 1}
 
        Em7        A7sus4      A7          Dmaj7
Welcome back, your dreams were your ticket out
        Em7           A7sus4    A7            Dmaj7
Welcome back, to that same old place that you laughed about
          F#m7           B7                Em
Well, the names have all changed since you hung around
           Gm6                              Bm
But those dreams have remained, and they've turned around
 
 
{Pre-Chorus}
 
E7sus4                              E7
Who'd have thought they'd lead you (Who'd have thought they'd lead you)
     A7sus4                        A7
Back here where we need you? (Back here where we need you?)
 
 
{Chorus}
 
         Em7                       A7sus4         A7            Dmaj7
Yeah, we tease him a lot 'cause we got him on the spot, welcome back
        Em7           A7            Dmaj7
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
        Em7           A7
Welcome back, welcome back

Welcome back, we always could spot a friend
        Em7         A7sus4       A7            Dmaj7
Welcome back, and I smile when I think how you must have been
      F#m7        B7             Em
And I know what a scene you were learnin' in
          Gm6                          Bm
Was there somethin' that made you come back again?
 
 
{Pre-Chorus}
 
    E7sus4                     E7
And what could ever lead you  (What could ever lead you)
     A7sus4                         A7
Back here where we need you?  (Back here where we need you?)
 
 
{Chorus}
 
         Em7                       A7sus4         A7            Dmaj7
Yeah, we tease him a lot 'cause we got him on the spot, welcome back
        Em7           A7            Dmaj7
Welcome back, welcome back, welcome back
        Em7           A7
Welcome back, welcome back
